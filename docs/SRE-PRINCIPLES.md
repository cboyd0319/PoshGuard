## Service Overview

**Service Name**: PoshGuard PowerShell QA & Auto-Fix Engine  
**Service Type**: Local Developer Tool / CI/CD Integration  
**Deployment Model**: Self-hosted (user workstation, CI pipeline)  
**User Journey**: Developer fixes PowerShell code quality issues

## User Journeys

### Primary Journey: Auto-Fix PowerShell Scripts
```
Developer → Invoke Apply-AutoFix → File Analysis → Fix Application → Validation → Output
                    ↓                    ↓               ↓              ↓
                 Success            PSScriptAnalyzer  AST Transform  Write File
                 Rate: 95%          Detection         Application     Success
```

**Critical Success Criteria**:
1. Fixes applied without introducing syntax errors (100%)
2. Detected violations reduced by ≥70% (first pass)
3. Processing time <5s per file (p95)
4. Zero data loss (backups + rollback)

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### 1. Availability SLI
**Definition**: Percentage of time PoshGuard successfully processes files without fatal errors

**Measurement**:
```
Availability = (Successful Operations / Total Operations) × 100
```

**Data Source**: Exit codes, log analysis  
**Measurement Window**: 28 days rolling

### 2. Latency SLI
**Definition**: Time from invocation to completion for file processing

**Measurement**:
```
Latency_p95 = 95th percentile processing time (milliseconds)
Latency_p99 = 99th percentile processing time (milliseconds)
```

**Data Source**: Benchmark logs, CI pipeline durations  
**Measurement Window**: 7 days rolling

### 3. Quality SLI
**Definition**: Percentage of detected violations successfully auto-fixed

**Measurement**:
```
Quality = (Violations Fixed / Violations Detected) × 100
```

**Data Source**: PSScriptAnalyzer before/after comparison  
**Measurement Window**: Per benchmark run

### 4. Correctness SLI
**Definition**: Percentage of fixed files that parse without syntax errors

**Measurement**:
```
Correctness = (Valid AST After Fix / Total Fixed Files) × 100
```

**Data Source**: AST parser validation, Pester tests  
**Measurement Window**: Per run

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### SLO 1: Availability
**Target**: 99.5% of operations complete successfully  
**Error Budget**: 0.5% failure rate = ~3.6 hours/month  
**Measurement**: Exit code 0 vs non-zero over 28 days

**Alerting Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: <99.7% availability (budget 60% consumed)
- **Critical**: <99.5% availability (budget exhausted)

**Burn Rate**:
- **1-hour burn**: 50% error rate = 1440× normal
- **6-hour burn**: 10% error rate = 72× normal

### SLO 2: Latency (p95)
**Target**: 95% of file operations complete in <5 seconds  
**Error Budget**: 5% may exceed 5 seconds  
**Measurement**: Processing time from start to completion

**File Size Categories**:
- < 1KB: p95 < 500ms
- 1-10KB: p95 < 2s
- 10-100KB: p95 < 5s
- 100KB-10MB: p95 < 30s

**Alerting Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: p95 > 6s (20% over target)
- **Critical**: p95 > 10s (100% over target)

### SLO 3: Fix Quality
**Target**: 70% of detected violations fixed on first pass  
**Stretch Goal**: 85% fix rate by v3.2.0  
**Measurement**: Benchmark success rate

**Current Baseline**: 74.07% (as of v3.0.0)

**Alerting Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: <75% fix rate (regression)
- **Critical**: <70% fix rate (SLO miss)

### SLO 4: Correctness
**Target**: 100% of fixed files maintain valid PowerShell syntax  
**Error Budget**: 0% tolerance for syntax-breaking changes  
**Measurement**: AST parsing post-fix

**Alerting Thresholds**:
- **Warning**: N/A (zero tolerance)
- **Critical**: Any syntax error introduced

## Error Budget Policy

### Budget Calculation
```
Monthly Error Budget = (1 - SLO Target) × Total Requests × 30 days

Example (Availability):
Error Budget = (1 - 0.995) × 1000 requests/day × 30 days
            = 0.005 × 30,000
            = 150 failed requests/month
```

### Budget Consumption Rules

#### Green (0-50% budget consumed)
- **Action**: Normal feature development
- **Priority**: New features, optimizations, refactoring
- **Deployment**: Standard release cadence (monthly)
- **Testing**: Standard test coverage requirements

#### Yellow (50-80% budget consumed)
- **Action**: Feature freeze, focus on reliability
- **Priority**: Bug fixes, performance improvements only
- **Deployment**: Emergency fixes only, increased testing
- **Testing**: Enhanced test coverage, load testing

#### Red (80-100% budget consumed)
- **Action**: Full incident response mode
- **Priority**: Reliability work exclusively
- **Deployment**: Rollback to last known good version
- **Testing**: Comprehensive regression testing required

#### Exhausted (>100% budget consumed)
- **Action**: Declare incident, emergency response
- **Priority**: Root cause analysis, immediate fix
- **Deployment**: Hotfix release only after validation
- **Postmortem**: Required within 48 hours

### Budget Reset
Error budgets reset on the 1st of each month. Historical trends tracked for capacity planning.

## Observability & Monitoring

### Metrics Collection

#### Golden Signals (Instrumentation Points)

**Latency Metrics**:
```powershell
# At start of processing
$startTime = Get-Date

# At end of processing
$duration = (Get-Date) - $startTime
Write-Metric -Name "poshguard.processing.duration" -Value $duration.TotalMilliseconds -Unit "ms"
```

**Traffic Metrics**:
```powershell
# Count of files processed
Write-Metric -Name "poshguard.files.processed" -Value 1 -Unit "count"
```

**Errors Metrics**:
```powershell
# Count of failures
Write-Metric -Name "poshguard.operations.failed" -Value 1 -Unit "count"
Write-Metric -Name "poshguard.operations.succeeded" -Value 1 -Unit "count"
```

**Saturation Metrics**:
```powershell
# Memory usage
$memoryMB = [System.GC]::GetTotalMemory($false) / 1MB
Write-Metric -Name "poshguard.memory.used" -Value $memoryMB -Unit "MB"
```

### Logging Standards

**Structured Logging (JSONL)**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T11:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "File processed successfully",
  "trace_id": "934e6f95-64fe-44f6-b7c4-ac4ae264a7f2",
  "operation": "apply_fix",
  "file": "script.ps1",
  "duration_ms": 1234,
  "violations_before": 10,
  "violations_after": 2,
  "success": true
}
```

**Correlation IDs**:
- Every operation has unique `trace_id` (GUID)
- Trace ID propagates through all log entries
- Enables end-to-end request tracing

### Incident Management

#### Severity Levels

**SEV-1 (Critical)**:
- User data loss or corruption
- Syntax errors introduced by fixes
- Service unavailable for >1 hour
- Security vulnerability exploited

**SEV-2 (High)**:
- Degraded performance (p95 > 10s)
- Partial service outage (<50% availability)
- Error budget exhausted
- Security vulnerability disclosed

**SEV-3 (Medium)**:
- Non-critical feature broken
- Warning-level SLO breaches
- Error budget >50% consumed

**SEV-4 (Low)**:
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation errors
- Nice-to-have feature requests

#### Incident Response Workflow

```
Detect → Triage → Mitigate → Resolve → Postmortem → Prevent
   ↓        ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
Alert    SEV-X   Rollback   Root Fix   Document   Automation
```

**Mitigation Options**:
1. **Rollback**: Revert to previous version (fastest)
2. **Feature Flag**: Disable problematic feature
3. **Hotfix**: Deploy emergency patch
4. **Manual Intervention**: Direct user support

### Postmortem Requirements

**Required for**: SEV-1, SEV-2 incidents  
**Timeline**: Draft within 24 hours, final within 48 hours  
**Audience**: All engineering, stakeholders

**Template**:
1. **Summary**: One-paragraph overview
2. **Timeline**: Chronological incident events
3. **Root Cause**: Technical analysis (5 Whys)
4. **Impact**: User-facing and business impact
5. **Lessons Learned**: What went well, what didn't
6. **Action Items**: Concrete improvements with owners

**Blameless Culture**: Focus on systems, not individuals. No punishment for postmortem participation.

### Capacity Planning

**Monthly Review**:
- Analyze traffic trends (files processed)
- Evaluate error budget consumption
- Review SLO attainment
- Plan infrastructure scaling

**Quarterly Review**:
- Update SLOs based on user expectations
- Refine error budgets
- Adjust alerting thresholds
- Plan major reliability improvements

## Reliability Investment

### Engineering Time Allocation

**Target Split**:
- **50%**: Feature development (new rules, IDE integration)
- **30%**: Reliability work (performance, observability, testing)
- **20%**: Technical debt, refactoring, documentation

**Error Budget Enforcement**:
- Budget exhausted → 100% reliability work until restored
- Budget <50% → 70% reliability, 30% features
