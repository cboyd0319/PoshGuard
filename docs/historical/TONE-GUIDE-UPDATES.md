This document tracks application of the tone guide to all repository documentation.

## Completed Files

### Templates

## Key Changes Applied

### Removed
- Sales adjectives (THE WORLD'S BEST, REVOLUTIONARY, QUANTUM LEAP, etc.)
- Emojis in headings and body text

- Buzzwords (leverage, seamlessly, cutting-edge)

### Applied

- Answer first, why second structure
- Paragraphs â‰¤ 3 sentences
- Bullets over prose walls
- Scannable tables for configuration
- Runnable code blocks with clear context

## Tone Guide Principles Reference

1. **Plainspoken, first-person** - No buzzwords, state facts
2. **Answer first, why second** - TL;DR up top
3. **Active, present tense** - "Run this"
4. **Security-minded** - One-liner risk and fix when relevant
5. **No sales adjectives** - Ban leverage, utilize, seamlessly, cutting-edge

## Validation

Run markdown linting:
```bash
npm i -g markdownlint-cli
markdownlint "**/*.md"
```

Check for banned words:
```bash
grep -r "leverage\|utilize\|seamlessly\|cutting-edge\|game-changing" docs/ README.md
```

## Notes

This update focused on high-impact files (README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, quick-start, PR template).
Remaining files follow similar patterns and can be updated incrementally as they're touched for other changes.
The linting configuration enforces consistent formatting going forward.
