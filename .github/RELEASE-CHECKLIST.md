   Unlist-PSGalleryPackage -Name PoshGuard -Version {VERSION}
   ```

2. **Create Hotfix**
   - Branch from release tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/{VERSION}.1 v{VERSION}`
   - Fix critical issue
   - Test thoroughly
   - Release as {VERSION}.1

3. **Communication**
   - Post issue on GitHub
   - Tweet about known issue
   - Update release notes with known issues
   - Provide workaround if available

## Version Numbering Guide

Follow Semantic Versioning (semver.org):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0): Breaking changes
  - API changes that break existing code
  - Removed features
  - Fundamentally different behavior

- **MINOR** (1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
  - New auto-fix rules
  - New command-line options
  - Performance improvements
  - New module functions

- **PATCH** (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1): Bug fixes, backwards compatible
  - Fix existing auto-fix logic
  - Documentation corrections
  - Security patches
  - Dependency updates

## Release Cadence

Recommended schedule:

- **Major releases**: 6-12 months (breaking changes)
- **Minor releases**: 1-2 months (new features)
- **Patch releases**: As needed (bug fixes)
- **Security releases**: Immediately (security issues)

## Support Policy

- **Current version**: Full support
- **Previous minor**: Security fixes only
- **Older versions**: Community support only

## Quality Gates

Before any release:

- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… No critical/high security alerts
- âœ… Code scanning passing
- âœ… Documentation complete
- âœ… CHANGELOG updated
- âœ… Manual testing completed
- âœ… Sample scripts validated

## Emergency Release Process

For critical security issues:

1. Create private security advisory
2. Develop fix in private fork
3. Test fix thoroughly
4. Coordinate disclosure timeline
5. Release patch immediately
6. Publish security advisory
7. Notify users via all channels

## Post-Mortem (after major releases)

Within 1 week:

- [ ] What went well?
- [ ] What could be improved?
- [ ] Were timelines realistic?
- [ ] Did we catch issues early enough?
- [ ] Update this checklist with lessons learned
